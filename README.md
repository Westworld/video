Not to be used as base for projects! Not even as example…

If you read this, don’t waste your time.

This is just a playground, to try new features and code ideas. Not used in production. Started with 4D v1, using RTF for database publishing. Later with v2 using 4D Write. With v3 using MIF and FrameMaker for database publishing. With v6/1996 trying how to build web sites, how to use HTML for publishing Later using 4D IC, Web Service, than HTTP Get, to fetch data from other services And so on. Trying new features, trying ORDA. Runs only interpreted, never used for preemptive, tons of interprocess variables. Many code parts dead, never removed, written for previous ideas.

Don’t waste your time. Nothing useful here.
